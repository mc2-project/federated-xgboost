# Federated XGBoost

## Introduction

**Federated XGBoost** is a gradient boosted library for the federated setting, based off the popular [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) project. In addition to offering the same efficiency, flexibility, and portability that vanilla XGBoost provides, Federated XGBoost enables multiple parties to jointly compute a model while keeping their data on site, avoiding the need for a central data storage. 

This project is currently under development as part of the broader **mc<sup>2</sup>** effort (i.e., **M**ultiparty **C**ollaboration and **C**oopetition) by the UC Berkeley [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/).

Please feel free to reach out to us if you would like to use Federated XGBoost for your applications. We also welcome contributions to our work!
