# Generating certificates and keys
There are two scripts in this directory.
* `gen-root.sh`: Run this script to generate a root certificate `root_cert.crt` and root keypair (`root.pem`, `root.pub`)
* `gen-agg.sh`: Run this script to regenerate a certificate `cert_chain.crt` and private key `private_key.pem` for the aggregator.
